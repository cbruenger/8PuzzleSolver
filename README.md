A java implementation of an 8-Puzzle solver using bfs, dfs, uniform-cost search, greedy-best-first search, and three different A* searches (using different heuristics).

This project was completed with the purpose of using basic AI search methods in order to solve a single agent prolem in a discrete and fully-observable state-space.
